How did viewing a diff between two versions of a file help you see the bug that was introduced?
graphical takes you to the exact change those were made and easy to spot the differences between two files

How could having easy access to the entire history of a file make you a more efficient programmer in the long term?
Easy to point an issue bug introduced

What do you think are the pros and cons of manually choosing when to create a commit, like you do in Git, vs having versions automatically saved, like Google Docs does?
Commit per logical change

Why do you think some version control systems, like Git, allow saving multiple files in one commit, while others, like Google Docs, treat each file separately?
Git thinks a logical combination of files as one repositories and saves the state of one repository at one time rather than one file at one time

How can you use the commands git log and git diff to view the history of files?
git log to retrieve all the history 
git diff to find the difference between two commits

How might using version control make you more confident to make changes that could break something?
Didn't fully understand the question. It makes us feel secure as we will be able to compare the difference between the versions which can tell us about when the bug was introduced


Now that you have your workspace set up, what do you want to try using Git for?
